# Decathlon Points Calculator

## Objective
The objective of the provided C code is to calculate the total Decathlon points for multiple performers participating in the Decathlon event. It achieves this by prompting the user to input data regarding each performer's performance in ten different events, applying a predefined scoring formula based on constants A, B, and C, and displaying the cumulative points.

## Abstract
The program is designed to assess the overall athletic performance of individuals in a Decathlon, collecting information on their results in ten events, applying a predefined scoring formula with constants, and presenting the total Decathlon points as an indicator of the athlete's overall achievement.

## Algorithm
- Set constants A, B, and C.
- Get the number of performers (n).
- Create arrays to store performer names, results, and total points.
- For each performer:
  - Input their name and performance results for each of the 10 events.
  - Calculate the total points for each performer based on the given formula.
- Identify the performer with the highest total points.
- Display the results, including each performer's total points and the performer with the highest points.
